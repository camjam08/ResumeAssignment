            <h1>Camryn Jamison</h1>
            <h2>Graphic Designer & Marketing Writer</h2>

            <p>Hi there, welcome to my resume! My love for writing and design blossomed during the summer of 2014 while interning at The Wake Weekly, a local newspaper based in Wake Forest, where I had my own "Ask Cam" column. I currently study Graphic Design and Advertising at Wake Technical Community College. I was born in Raleigh and moved to rural Wake Forest with my parents when I was four years old. I'm proud to call Wake Forest home and enjoy the atmosphere of historic downtown. When not at work, I spend time with friends, take long walks outdoors and drive my Volkswagen around town.</p>
